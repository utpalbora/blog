<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>I am Utpal Bora, a doctoral student at IIT Hyderabad, India. My research area is Programming Languages and Compiler Optimizations.
Currently I am working on improving vectorization opportunities in the LLVM compiler infrastructure.
My research interest also includes polyhedral compilation techniques.<br/>

My hometown is Jorhat. A place 280km to East of Guwahati. I have been living out of my hometown for past 11 years and I miss every now and then the greenary and frequent showers. Hoping to go back to Assam pretty soon.

    “You say you love rain, but you use an umbrella to walk under it. You say you love sun, but you seek shelter when it is shining. You say you love wind, but when it comes you close your windows. So that's why I'm scared when you say you love me.”
